# Agents (Runtime artifacts that should not be committed if they are local-only)
# For the TOOL itself, we want to commit .agents/schemas, etc. but typically
# downstream usage might ignore some .agents content if it was purely transient.
# However, the 'control plane' (.agents/priorities, index, tasks) IS meant to be committed.
# So we only ignore the temp artifacts.
